# no-blind-image-restore
The "non-blind" deconvolution approach implies the use of classical linear recovery methods: the Wiener parametric filter, the Lucy-Richardson  method, the Kalman filter, reverse filtering, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Wiener filter is the very first method of solving the problem of restoring a distorted image.
It was proposed by the American mathematician Norbert Wiener in the 1940s and received publication in 1949. 
It was originally intended to separate the useful signal from the noise. 
In further development, the Wiener filter began to be used for image processing.
